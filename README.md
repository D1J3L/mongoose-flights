# AeroStats
---------------
Welcome to AeroStats! Combining transponder data API(updates every 10 seconds no limit) and a mapping API, we can plot all the planes in a specific area on map.
The planes will be clickable to reveal its velocity, heading direction, country of origin etc
These data will be used for CRUD-ing, such as saving to watchlist(to be clicked at a later date and revealed in another map), commented/edited if saved into watchlist, as well as deleted if necessary
